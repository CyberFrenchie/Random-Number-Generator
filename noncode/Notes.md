# Please read this.

Hey everybody, I've been making changes to this repository almost every week. However, I have other projects and need to work on those too. I'm looking to anyone who can create and automatic update for everybody who uses this on Replit. If you can, email me at `sasha.craftyshark@gmail.com`
For some quick context, the code is going to be used by many people, and I need a way for them to automatically install the newest code so it rewrites the original file to the newest version through `pip`.
The code should be formatted as: 
```python
if i == 'update':
  if code_version = version:
    print('You are all up to date!')
    while True:
      random_gen()
  else:
    print('You need to update!')
    # Update logic here...

```
`code_version` is written in the code. `version` is the variable that is written in a file that is changed by only me.
