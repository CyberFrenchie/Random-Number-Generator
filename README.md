Hi, this is my random number generator.
To use it, run the code and enter the first number when prompted.
Then, enter the second number.
It will give you a random number from the first number to the second one.
If the numbers are the same, it will tell you that.
Unfortunately, you cannot enter negative numbers, but I am currently working on that. (Coming in update 1.5)
It will automatically start over when you are done with generation.
Thank you for using this generator!
