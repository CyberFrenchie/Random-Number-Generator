Hi, this is my random number generator.
To use it, run the code and enter the first number when prompted.
Then, enter the second number.
It will give you a random number from the first number to the second one.
A common misconception is that it does it between the numbers, but albeit the error code will say (600, 4, -596), when you enter 600 and 3, it still includes the numbers.
It will automatically start over when you are done with generation.
Thank you for using this generator!
