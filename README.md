# Random Number Generator

Hi, this is my random number generator.
To use it, run the code and enter the first number when prompted.
Then, enter the second number.
It will give you a random number from the first number to the second one.
If the numbers are the same, it will tell you that.
It will automatically start over when you are done with generation.
Thank you for using this generator!
Website coming at v2.0!
